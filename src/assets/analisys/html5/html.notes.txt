2.4 Common microsyntaxes:

  There are various places in HTML that accept particular data types, such as dates or numbers. This section describes what the conformance criteria for content in those formats is, and how to parse them.

  The space characters, for the purposes of this specification, are U+0020 SPACE, "tab" (U+0009), "LF" (U+000A), "FF" (U+000C), and "CR" (U+000D).

  The White_Space characters are those that have the Unicode property "White_Space" in the Unicode PropList.txt data file. [UNICODE]

  [...]

  2.4.2 Boolean attributes:

    A number of attributes are boolean attributes. The presence of a boolean attribute on an element represents the true value, and the absence of the attribute represents the false value.

    If the attribute is present, its value must either be the empty string or a value that is an ASCII case-insensitive match for the attribute's canonical name, with no leading or trailing whitespace.

    The values "true" and "false" are not allowed on boolean attributes. To represent a false value, the attribute has to be omitted altogether.

    Here is an example of a checkbox that is checked and disabled. The checked and disabled attributes are the boolean attributes.

      <label><input type=checkbox checked name=cheese disabled> Cheese</label>

    This could be equivalently written as this:

      <label><input type=checkbox checked=checked name=cheese disabled=disabled> Cheese</label>

    You can also mix styles; the following is still equivalent:

      <label><input type='checkbox' checked name=cheese disabled=""> Cheese</label>

3.2.5 Global attributes:

  The following attributes are common to and may be specified on all HTML elements (even those not defined in this specification):
    accesskey
    class
    contenteditable
    dir
    hidden
    id
    lang
    spellcheck
    style
    tabindex
    title
    translate

    disabled - Whether the form control is disabled
    form - Associates the control with a form element
    formaction - URL to use for form submission
    formenctype - Form data set encoding type to use for form submission
    formmethod - HTTP method to use for form submission
    formnovalidate - Bypass form control validation for form submission
    formtarget - Browsing context for form submission
    height - Vertical dimension
    inputmode - Hint for selecting an input modality
    list - List of autocomplete options
    max - Maximum value
    maxlength - Maximum length of value
    min - Minimum value
    minlength - Minimum length of value
    multiple - Whether to allow multiple values
    name - Name of form control to use for form submission and in the form.elements API
    pattern - Pattern to be matched by the form control's value
    placeholder - User-visible label to be placed within the form control
    readonly - Whether to allow the value to be edited by the user
    required - Whether the control is required for form submission
    size - Size of the control
    src - Address of the resource
    step - Granularity to be matched by the form control's value
    type - Type of form control
    value - Value of the form control
    width - Horizontal dimension

    + Global attributes

  Common attributes:
    autocomplete: A string indicating the type of autocomplete functionality, if any, to allow on the input
    autofocus: A Boolean which, if present, makes the input take focus when the form is presented
    disabled: A Boolean attribute which is present if the input should be disabled
    form: The id of the <form> of which the input is a member; if absent, the input is a member of the nearest containing form, or is not a member of a form at all
    list: The id of a <datalist> element that provides a list of suggested values for the input
    name: The input's name, to identify the input in the data submitted with the form's data
    readonly: A Boolean attribute which, if true, indicates that the input cannot be edited
    required: A Boolean which, if true, indicates that the input must have a value before the form can be submitted
    tabindex: A numeric value providing guidance to the user agent as to the order in which controls receive focus when the user presses the Tab key
    type: A string indicating which input type the <input> element represents
    value: A specific value
